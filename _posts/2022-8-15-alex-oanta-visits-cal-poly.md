We had a blast attending Alex Oanta’s talk at Cal Poly on water purification with Covalent Organic Frameworks and what graduate school is like. Alex is a graduate student in the Dichtel Research Group at Northwestern University. Here is a picture of several Cal Poly students (including some students from the Hamachi group) with Alex at “Boba with the Speaker.”
