The Hamachi Group goes to the Fall 2024 American Chemical Society Meeting in Denver, CO. Undergraduate students Hannah Negri, Jeffrey Johnson, and Sachi Ottoes presented posters, and Dr. Hamachi gave an oral presentation. We enjoyed getting to catch up with lab alumna Hannah Martin, who is currently pursuing a PhD at Colorado School of Mines with Mike McGuirk.
