In recognition of everyoneâ€™s hard work this summer and contributions to the research group, we celebrated the end of summer research this year with dinner at Olive Garden! What a tasty treat! We unfortunately forgot to take a photo at the restaurant, so here is a photo of us waiting for our table at Target instead.
