The Hamachi Group celebrated our recent publication on <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ra/d3ra02202a">COF-300 colloid synthesis</a> by going to <a href="https://mcconnells.com/">McConnell’s Ice Cream</a>. What a delicious treat! We are proud of the 7 undergraduate and 2 masters student coauthors who contributed to the research paper.
