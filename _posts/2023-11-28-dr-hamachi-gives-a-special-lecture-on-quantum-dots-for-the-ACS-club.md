Dr. Hamachi gave a special lecture on Quantum Dots for the ACS Club to explain the science behind the <a href = "https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2023/summary/">2023 Chemistry Nobel Prize</a>. Dr. Hamachi's PhD work focused on Quantum Dot synthesis, and Dr. Louis Brus (one of the Nobel Prize recipients) was on her PhD Thesis Committee!

Check out the special "Quantum Dot Cookies" that Dr. Hamachi made as lecture snacks. The larger the cookie, the more red-shifted the M&M's due to Quantum Confinement.
