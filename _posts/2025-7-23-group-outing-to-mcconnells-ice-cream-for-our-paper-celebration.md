The Hamachi Group celebrated our recent publication on <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/chemistry/fulltext/S2589-5974(25)00136-4">A Surface Level Introduction to Covalent Organic Framework Colloids</a> by going to <a href="https://mcconnells.com/">McConnell’s Ice Cream</a>. What a delicious treat! We are proud of the 3 undergraduate student coauthors who contributed to this paper.
