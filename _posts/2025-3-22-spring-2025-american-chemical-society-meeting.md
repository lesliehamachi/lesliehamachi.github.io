The Hamachi Group goes to the Spring 2025 American Chemical Society Meeting in San Diego, CA. Undergraduate students Hannah Negri, Jeffrey Johnson, Zoe Jackson Delos Angeles, and Jackson Arroyo presented posters, and Dr. Hamachi gave an oral presentation. We enjoyed getting to catch up with lab alumna Daisy Kamp, who is currently pursuing a PhD at UC Irvine with Elizabeth Lee.
