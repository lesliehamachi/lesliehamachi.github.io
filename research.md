## Overview
<p>We perform interdisciplinary research at the interface of chemistry and materials science. In order to improve the function and properties of materials, we strive to understand them fundamentally via the tools of synthetic organic chemists. If you are a chemistry major who wants to apply knowledge from your coursework towards studying materials, or if you are a materials engineering major who would like to develop your chemical intuition, this may be the research experience for you!</p>

<p>We are seeking students who will work well in our collaborative team, who would strive to develop a growth based learning mindset and ask a lot of questions, and who have interest in the subject matter. Students are involved in every aspect of our research projects, including designing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating results through publications and presentations.</p>

<p>Interested students should read the following research introduction for new students and email [Dr. Hamachi](mailto:hamachi@calpoly.edu) with their resume to inquire about available projects.</p>

     <p style="font-size: 16px;">The accumulation of plastic waste in the environment is a growing problem. Ironically, these materials were first created as environmentally friendly synthetic alternatives to natural materials such as wood or bone. We call these synthetic materials “polymers” because they are composed of long connected chains of “monomers” which you can visualize similar to beads (monomers) making up a necklace (polymer).</p>

     <p style="font-size: 16px;">It turns out that we can use chemistry to assemble polymers in different configurations. Notably, there are thermoplastics which are composed of long linear chains, and thermosets which contain strong chemical bonds linking linear chains together (like a fishing net). These chemical bonds linking thermoset polymer chains together are called cross-links. Due to these differences in material structure, thermoplastics such as the polyethylene terephthalate, used in plastic water bottles, can be heated to be melted and recycled, whereas thermosets such as tires would burn upon heating instead of melting to be re-formed into a new shape. However, although you might think that thermoplastics are better since they can be recycled, both thermoplastics and thermosets have important uses. In particular, due to the additional chemical bonds, thermosets typically possess better mechanical properties.</p>
