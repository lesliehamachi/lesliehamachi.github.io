### More Information

Leslie was born and raised in Mountain View, CA. She obtained her BS in chemistry, with a concentration in materials chemistry, in 2013 from the University of California, Berkeley, graduating with honors. While at UC Berkeley, she conducted research in the [Alivisatos group](https://alivisatoslab.uchicago.edu/alumni/) and [Milliron group](https://nanocrystal.che.utexas.edu/index.html). She earned her PhD from Columbia University in 2018 in the [Owen lab](https://owen.chem.columbia.edu/), where she developed a library of new chalcogen precursors for use in rate controlled core/shell nanocrystal synthesis. After completing her PhD in 2018, she joined the [Dichtel lab](https://sites.northwestern.edu/dichtel/) at Northwestern University as a NSF Center for Sustainable Polymers postdoctoral research fellow. Leslie joined the faculty at Cal Poly in the department of chemistry and biochemistry in the fall of 2020.

Outside of the lab, Leslie is fascinated by the intersection of science and art. She taught chemistry as an adjunct professor at the [Fashion Institute of Technology](https://www.fitnyc.edu/) in the spring of 2018.
